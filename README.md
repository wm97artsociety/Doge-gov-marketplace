Bio & Deep System Analysis – July 2025 Edition

🧠 Overview

This software is a decentralized, HTML-based crypto marketplace platform built originally for Ethereum (ETH) and now fully converted to Dogecoin (DOGE). It functions as a complete front-to-back framework that allows users to:

Buy and sell NFTs, goods, and government-related digital products

Upload, display, and manage content via a browser-based interface

Accept Dogecoin as the native and exclusive payment method (manual or automated)


It is modular, file-based, and Firebase-compatible, with a modern u-panel interface for managing up to 24 product photos, metadata, and NFT info.
