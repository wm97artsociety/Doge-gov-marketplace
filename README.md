🐕‍🦺 DOGE-ENABLED CRYPTO MARKETPLACE — SOFTWARE BIO

feel free to attach my encryption to make it a 10 million marketplace once it is hooked up to a website server with people on it 

📦 Name:

DOGE-Gov NFT Marketplace (formerly ETH/USD Marketplace)

🌐 Overview:

This decentralized, crypto-native marketplace allows users to buy, sell, and interact with government, NFT, and digital goods services using Dogecoin (DOGE). Originally built for ETH, the platform has been fully re-coded to support DOGE as the base currency without changing your original HTML styling or structure.
